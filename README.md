# User-Activity-Monitor

### Description:

The project focuses on tracking user login and logout events on company machines. A Python script processes event logs to monitor which users are logged into which machines. The system captures login/logout actions and generates a report that lists all machines, along with the users currently logged in. This report helps IT administrators efficiently monitor network activity and machine usage in real time.
